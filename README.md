# EduSetu - Your Personal Learning Navigator

## Team Details
- **Team Name:** Team Setu
- **Team Members:** Krrish Dewangan,Sahil Ghosh, Somiya Ranjan Pradhan, Shivam Mishra

## Problem Statement
In today's digital age, students are overwhelmed by countless online resources like YouTube channels, apps, and courses. This 'information overload' leads to confusion, wasting precious time deciding *what* to study instead of actually studying, which results in stress and inefficient learning.

## Project Description
EduSetu is not another coaching app; it's a smart **"Google Maps for Learning"**. It acts as an intelligent navigator that solves the problem of "what to learn next?". Our platform creates a personalized, step-by-step learning roadmap for each student based on their specific goal (e.g., JEE, NEET, or Board Exams).

**Key Features:**
* **AI-Powered Roadmap:** Generates a clear, weekly study plan, guiding students on which topic to cover and when.
* **Curated Resource Aggregation:** Instead of creating content, EduSetu aggregates the best, freely available resources (like top YouTube videos, articles, and practice tests) from the internet.
* **Verified Content:** We use a hybrid model where resources are **AI-discovered and expert-approved**. Our smart tech scans thousands of resources, and then our team of educators hand-picks the absolute best for you, ensuring quality and relevance.
* **Gamified Learning:** Features like study streaks and badges keep students motivated and consistent.
* **Parental Dashboard:** A transparent dashboard for parents to monitor their child's progress and the quality of resources being used.

Our unique approach is being a **platform-neutral guide**, focusing solely on providing clarity and direction to the student, making learning simple, structured, and accessible for everyone.
